Due to message length constraints, would you like me to:
A) Create these 3 calculators in separate messages
B) Create simplified versions now and enhance later
C) Focus on one calculator at a time with your feedback

Current recommendation: Test BMI and Calorie calculators first,
then I'll implement the remaining 3 based on your feedback.
